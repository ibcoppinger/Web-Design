        <h3>The Dangers of Stingrays</h3>
        <p>While stingrays donâ€™t normally harm humans, they do hold all the power to. Stingrays generally spend their time buried under the sand. This gives easy access to being stepped on, normally unintentionally. Their spinal blades are commonly heard as either barb or stingers. The barb blades consist of cartilage and when threatened the stingers may puncture humans, which can be fatal depending on the location. In addition to the wound, they release complex venom that will cause severe pain. The most dangerous stingray is blue-spotted because of their venom but death is still extremely rare</p>
