        <h2>Similar Animals</h2>
        <p>Stingrays are often referred to as “flattened sharks” because of their unique comparison. But they are also very similar to other aquatic life. A skate fish almost looks identical to a stingray but they are actually in the family of Rajidae fish. However, the shark ray is a mix of all three families. It looks more like a shark but belongs to both the Stingray and Rajidae family.</p>

        <h3>Petting Stingrays</h3>
       <p>It is not advised to pet stingrays in the ocean but most aquariums give you the ability to safely interact with them. Studies have shown that the animals even enjoy it. It is safest to pet their backs with your pointer and middle finger. They have a very slimy texture but it actually keeps them healthier</p>

        <h3>Stingray Sighting</h3>
       <p>Stingrays are very curious animals and sometimes, depending on the area, they will swim right up to humans. The best shot of seeing them is in Costa Rica, Hawaii, The Maldives, The Bahamas, and The Cayman Islands. In the islands they have boats that take tourists out to a place called stingray bay to swim and feed them.</p>
