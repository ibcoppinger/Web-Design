        <h2>Exploring Mental Health</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>The Decline in Mental Health</h3>
        <p>In 2021, the United States had an average of 130 suicides per day. Since then, mental health has continued to decline, especially among teenagers. There is an obvious dip in these statistics whenever COVID-19 occurred. The most common issues are depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, and eating disorders. These are generally formed after childhood abuse, trauma, neglect, social disadvantage, poverty, stress, loneliness, and/or isolation. Even though there are thousands of statistics focused on mental health, many people still do not take it seriously.</p>

        <h3>Effects on The Brain </h3>
        <p>Depression alters the brain and can change the way you think or act. Studies have shown that it shows up in neurotransmitter dysfunction, brain inflammation, and/or smaller volumes of gray matter. Gray matter is a type of tissue in your central nervous system that controls how you function every day. The adjustment to your neurotransmitters and network activity oversees our behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. This explains why our behavior changes when our mental health decreases and in severe cases it can make your personality unrecognizable.</p>

        <h3>Additional Health Concerns</h3>
        <p>People with depression also have a more active amygdala than others. This will affect your emotions and decision-making skills. You can tell the difference between the brain of someone with mental health problems versus no issues in a PET scan of the brain. Depression does not just affect your brain; it alters your entire body. It can cause joint/limb pain, sleep problems, gastrointestinal problems, and other body aches.</p>

        <h3>Finding A Therapist</h3>
       <p>Whether it is finding a therapist for you or somebody else, it can be a frustrating process. Thankfully, there are resources available that check your location, financial status, and find exactly what you are looking for. This allows you to view their profiles and when you find the right one, set up an appointment. However, it might take a few sessions to find your perfect match.</p>

        <h3>Stingray Sighting</h3>
       <p>Stingrays are very curious animals and sometimes, depending on the area, they will swim right up to humans. The best shot of seeing them is in Costa Rica, Hawaii, The Maldives, The Bahamas, and The Cayman Islands. In the islands they have boats that take tourists out to a place called stingray bay to swim and feed them.</p>
