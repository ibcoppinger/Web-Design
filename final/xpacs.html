        <h2>Exploring Mental Health</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>The Hardest Years</h3>
        <p>Depression and anxiety rates are highest among 10- to 20-year-olds. Around 60% of teenagers experience depression and 35% experience suicidal thoughts. This makes suicide the fourth leading cause of death in adolescence. Within these years teenagers are exposed to adversity, physical changes, hormone changes, pressure from peers, social media, etc. This is packed onto the childhood trauma most have already dealt with by this age. These changes can affect decision making, grades/school, and both mental and physical health.</p>

        <h3>Social Media</h3>
        <p>Social media is proven to be one of the worst things for your mental health. Teenagers will compare themselves to everything they see even though it is all edited to perfection. This is the leading cause of eating disorders. Or when they post something, it is common to get hate or bad feedback from their peers. However, phones also make teenagers feel less alone if they are connected digitally. Overall, it can be a healthy form of communication and even escapism but only in moderation.</p>

        <h3>Watching for Signs</h3>
        <p>Teens will often give signs of depression, but some will hide it better than others whether they are trying to or not. The main signs to look out for are constant sleeping, tough time concentrating, appetite change, loss of interest in activities, irritability, anger, lethargic, drinking/drug use, harmful behaviors, drop in grades, and many more. Moving forward depends on the severity of the issues. But statistics show that most teenagers drastically improved after mental health counseling and/or medication.</p>

        <h3>Petting Stingrays</h3>
       <p>It is not advised to pet stingrays in the ocean but most aquariums give you the ability to safely interact with them. Studies have shown that the animals even enjoy it. It is safest to pet their backs with your pointer and middle finger. They have a very slimy texture but it actually keeps them healthier</p>

        <h3>Stingray Sighting</h3>
       <p>Stingrays are very curious animals and sometimes, depending on the area, they will swim right up to humans. The best shot of seeing them is in Costa Rica, Hawaii, The Maldives, The Bahamas, and The Cayman Islands. In the islands they have boats that take tourists out to a place called stingray bay to swim and feed them.</p>
