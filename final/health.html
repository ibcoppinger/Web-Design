        <h2>Exploring Mental Health</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Therapy Benefits</h3>
        <p>Different methods of coping and healing depend on your age. For example, childhood issues are solved with therapy and behavioral help, but teenagers and adults might need medication. For all ages, therapy is a great option. Different therapists will specialize in various issues, normally depending on their own past and ability to relate to their patients. Everyone can benefit from therapy even if it is just to get out your feelings to someone or discuss how to cope if mental health issues arise.</p>

        <h3>Day to Day Coping</h3>
        <p>Taking care of yourself and your mental health is an everyday choice not just once a week, or month, at therapy. For example, sleep, exercise, gratitude, journaling, alone time, and relaxing can improve happiness. Learning your own mind is also especially important. Knowing how to change your perspective from negative to positive or to acknowledge when you are doing something harmful for you mentally can make a world of difference. Improving your own mental health can also give you tips to help those you care about with their own issues.</p>

        <h3>Medication Benefits</h3>
        <p>While there are mixed feelings about using medication for mental health, it has been proven that different medications can be specific and effective to your certain mental health issues. While it might take a few tries to find medication that works for you, it will be worth it in the end. One of the biggest issues with finding help for mental health is the stigma about being weak if you ask for help. Taking care of yourself will never make you weak, it will help you live a happier and healthier lifestyle.</p>

        <h3>Petting Stingrays</h3>
       <p>It is not advised to pet stingrays in the ocean but most aquariums give you the ability to safely interact with them. Studies have shown that the animals even enjoy it. It is safest to pet their backs with your pointer and middle finger. They have a very slimy texture but it actually keeps them healthier</p>

        <h3>Stingray Sighting</h3>
       <p>Stingrays are very curious animals and sometimes, depending on the area, they will swim right up to humans. The best shot of seeing them is in Costa Rica, Hawaii, The Maldives, The Bahamas, and The Cayman Islands. In the islands they have boats that take tourists out to a place called stingray bay to swim and feed them.</p>
