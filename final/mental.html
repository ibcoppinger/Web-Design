        <h2>Exploring Mental Health</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Life In Your 20s</h3>
        <p>In later years, stress comes more from figuring out your identity, financial/ work issues, losing loved ones, navigating diverse types of relationships, etc. In your 20s there are so many changes to your life to move through. Many adults experience loneliness after graduating because of the pressure to figure out their future, moving out/away, growing apart from people, etc. These issues can be referred to as a quarter of a life crisis. Stress is at an all-time high from your 20s to your 30s so it is important to take care of yourself within these years.</p>

        <h3>Reaching Your 30s</h3>
        <p>ach your 30s there is a lot of pressure around being successful in your work, forming a lasting relationship, and starting a family. Also, as you grow, you will experience psychological changes such as being less open to trying new things, more introverted, and more neurotic. Reaching the point of starting a family means you have less time to take care of yourself and your mental health because you are more focused on taking care of them. Reaching your 40s is proven to decrease your mental health by trying to juggle so many responsibilities at the same time. But, by now, you have grown into your own identity and have learned more about your own mental health and how to cope/heal.</p>

        <h3>Mental Health As You Grow</h3>
        <p>As you get older, your mental health is very dependent on the individual person. When you are younger mostly you and your peers go through the same things. But now, people can be successful, just now starting a career, struggling with addictions, starting a family, etc. This can cause loneliness, comparing success, and stress. For the majority, getting older means improved mental health because you have an established life, know how to manage your responsibilities, and do not experience many changes. The biggest change as you grow will be losing people in your life whether that is growing apart, a falling out, or death.</p>

        <h3>Petting Stingrays</h3>
       <p>It is not advised to pet stingrays in the ocean but most aquariums give you the ability to safely interact with them. Studies have shown that the animals even enjoy it. It is safest to pet their backs with your pointer and middle finger. They have a very slimy texture but it actually keeps them healthier</p>

        <h3>Stingray Sighting</h3>
       <p>Stingrays are very curious animals and sometimes, depending on the area, they will swim right up to humans. The best shot of seeing them is in Costa Rica, Hawaii, The Maldives, The Bahamas, and The Cayman Islands. In the islands they have boats that take tourists out to a place called stingray bay to swim and feed them.</p>
